# IAS implementation in python 

Implementation of the [IAS(Princeton) architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) in Python (instruction fetch, decode, and execute).

This program just implements the two basic operations of addition and multiplication on two numbers.

To test the implementation: 
- `git clone https://github.com/shrey27tri01/IAS-python.git`
- `cd IAS-python`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `python test.py` or `python3 test.py`
